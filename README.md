# PIPELINED MIPS PROCESSOR USING VERILOG

## Description

This project consists of the implementation of a 32-bit 5-stage MIPS processor using the Verilog hardware description language.
- The MIPS architecture is a widely used instruction set architecture commonly found in embedded systems, microcontrollers, and low-power devices.
- The processor will implemented using the following stages:
  - IF (Instruction Fetch)
  - ID (Instruction Decode)
  - EX (Execution)
  - MEM (Memory Access)
  - WB (Write Back)
- The processor will be capable of executing the following instruction types:
  - R-type instructions
  - I-type instructions
  - J-type instructions
